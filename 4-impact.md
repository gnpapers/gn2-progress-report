What is the impact on the development of the principal discipline(s) of the project?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Describe how findings, results, techniques that were developed or extended, or other products from the project made an impact or are likely to make an impact on the base of knowledge, theory, and research and/or pedagogical methods in the principal disciplinary field(s) of the project.

Machine learning techniques developed for assessing the quality of scientific names
might significantly enhance scientific name resolution service. It is not good
enough to determine for sure if a name is 'real' and currently used -- the
technique is about 80% right at this stage. However it is already quite a good estimate of
quality of various large data sources. As a result when this approach/technique is fully
developed it will allow us to sort results by quality of the underlying data sources.  This will allow us to inform data set developers as to whether there data sets have improved (or degraded) with each subseqent release.

The services will be able to preserve biological and medical information
accumulated since the mid 18th century in case of revolutionary changes in
nomenclatural systems. In such cases our services would create a cross-mapping
bridge which will allow go bind together information from old and new
nomenclatural systems.

What is the impact on other disciplines?
----------------------------------------

### Describe how the findings, results, or techniques that were developed or improved, or other products from the project made an impact or are likely to make an impact on other disciplines.

During this project we further developed the Parsing Expression Grammer library for
Scala parboiled2, also we got ideas as to how we can improve the underlying parsing mechanism
to dramatically improve performance. We are planning to develop these ideas during the
next Google Summer of Code season.

What is the impact on the development of human resources?
---------------------------------------------------------

### Describe how the project made an impact or is likely to make an impact on human resource development in science, engineering, and technology.

During the project we mentored students for 2 Google Summer of Code projects,
we also participated in student training through the NSF funded Phylotastic
project.

What is the impact on physical resources that form infrastructure?
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Describe ways, if any, in which the project made an impact, or is likely to make an impact, on physical resources that form infrastructure, Including physical resources such as facilities, laboratories, or instruments.

With migration of the project to Unviersity of Illinois we are creating a
failsafe computer cluster to make Global Names services very scalable and
reliable.

What is the impact on information resources that form infrastructure?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Describe ways, if any, in which the project made an impact, or is likely to make an impact, on information resources that form infrastructure,

The project is an informatics infrastructure project. Services we develop would
become ubiquitously used for name finding and resolution. We are planning
to make resources in a way that will allow us to dramatically increase
throughput and capacity of the services.

What is the impact on technology transfer?
------------------------------------------

### Describe ways in which the project made an impact, or is likely to make an impact, on commercial technology or public use.

The open source nature of the project makes it possible for everyone to use our
algorithms, and learn how they work. Our use of Linux containers
significantly simplifies installation of developed services by anyone
interested in a local copy.

What is the impact on society beyond science and technology?
------------------------------------------------------------

### Describe how results from the project made an impact, or are likely to make an impact, beyond the bounds of science, engineering, and the academic world.

Scientific names are ubiquitous and we expect that our services will ultimately help to increase human wellbeing through better integration with services that monitor planet-wide ecological factors, and though facilitating the dissemination and interconnection of
information through species names.
