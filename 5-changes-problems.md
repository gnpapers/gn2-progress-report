Changes in approach and reasons for change
------------------------------------------

We had been able to move our approach from a radical refactoring of existing code to a fresh rewrite in a faster, more scalable language, Scala. This was possible thanks to the hiring of an extremely capable Scala programmer who
participated in core Scala development. 

Actual or Anticipated problems or delays and actions or plans to resolve them
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project had been conceived from within Encyclopedia of Life project. When
it was funded the EOL team shrank from 8 to 2 people and Dmitry Mozzherin was given the
task of moving the EOL to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, which
delayed development of the Global Names project from August 2014 to April 2015.
In November 2015 Dmitry accepted a position at University of Illinois, which
had been very beneficial for the Global Names Architecture in general, but created
delays while Dmitry was moving from Marine Biological Laboratory to University
of Illinois, moved and (re)assembled the underlying computer infrastructure, and reorganized the team.
There was also a critical delay associated with transfering this grant to U of I, which is not yet resolved (as of end of April 2016).

As a result funding for the first year in reality stretched over 2 years and
created challenges in preserving the current very capable team.  Additional delays in moving the grant to the UI will increase the probability of signficant delays and setbacks in the project.

Changes that have significant impact on expenditures
----------------------------------------------------

6 months of Dmitry's salary were moved towards Alexander Mylstev Scala
development efforts. This was made possible, and a result of, the move to the University
of Illinois.
